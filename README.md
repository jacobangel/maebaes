Somehow I convinced myself I'd like to understand Bayes' theorem better.

```
P(A|B) = P(A)P(B|A)/P(B)
```

where A and B are events.

`P(A)` and `P(B)` are the probabilities of A and B without regard to each other.
`P(A|B)`, a conditional probability, is the probability of A given that B is true.
`P(B|A)`, is the probability of B given that A is true.
